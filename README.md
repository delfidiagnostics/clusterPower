============

> [!IMPORTANT]

This is a form from [clusterPower](https://github.com/Kenkleinman/clusterPower/), which seems to be inactive. The package was archived in CRAN due to it failing CRAN tests, so forked this repo to apply [this fix](https://github.com/Kenkleinman/clusterPower/pull/226) to the bug we encountered.

We will rename this package from {clusterPower} to {clusterPowerDelfi} in order to avoid namespace clashes.
