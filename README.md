This is a form from [clusterPower](https://github.com/Kenkleinman/clusterPower/), which seems to be inactive. The package was archived in CRAN due to it failing CRAN tests, so forked this repo to apply [this fix](https://github.com/Kenkleinman/clusterPower/pull/226) to the bug we encountered.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_git(
  url = "git@github.com:delfidiagnostics/clusterPowerDelfi.git",
  force = TRUE,
  upgrade = FALSE
)
```
